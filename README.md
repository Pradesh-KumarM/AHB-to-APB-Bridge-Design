# AHB-to-APB-Bridge-Design
This project implements an AMBA AHB to APB Bridge in Verilog HDL.   The bridge enables communication between high-performance AHB masters and low-power APB peripherals, making it a key component in SoC designs.
---

## 🏗 Architecture
- **AHB Master** – Generates AHB transactions.
- **AHB Slave Interface** – Accepts transactions from AHB and forwards to APB controller.
- **APB Controller** – Controls APB transfers, generating control signals.
- **APB Interface** – Handles communication with APB peripherals.
- **Bridge Top Module** – Integrates all components.
- **Testbenches** – Verify functionality of each module and the complete system.

## 🛠 Features
- Full **Verilog HDL implementation** of AHB to APB Bridge.
- Supports **read and write transfers**.
- Separate **testbenches for all modules**.
- Simulated and verified using industry tools.
